    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",

    "\n",
    "Relational Databases store data that is inherently relational.  With the ongoing evolution of the internet and mobility (connected devices), many of the data used in contemporary applications and use-cases don't fit very well into relational schemas.  Additionally, as the need for so-called \"big data\" increases, the demand for large-scale queries increases.  Because of the inherent volume of data concerned, performance of a SQL database engine would not serve the use-case well.  NoSQL databases address this requirement by leveraging distrubuted computing, so that partitions of the data can be queried in parallel, thereby DRASTICALLY improving reponse time and performance in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending the above, suppose our use-case falls in the realm of \"big data\".  That is, for example, assume the \"WalMart\" example wherein an executive requires a high-level sales-summary report across the entire corporation for the quarter or even on an annual basis.  Across the corporation, this likely involves many billions of records, if not more.  Running such a query on your typical SQL database back-end, this query could take a very long time - possibly days to complete.  Because of the distributed nature that NoSQL architectures offer, this means that data is naturally partitioned in clusters and can be queried in parallel and, as a result, complete much, much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node is responsible for serving/managing a particular partition of the entire data set - i.e. only a subset.  A master server tracks which node is serving up queries for which partition.  This is called the \"Map\" step (in the MapReduce methodology).  When a query involves more than one paritition, the queried-parition result sets are later combined by a master server into the final, complete result set in the \"Reduce\" step.  Nodes also work together to back up one another's data (but still are responsible for exposing only a fixed partition of the data set).  So if a node goes offline, one of the other nodes can temporarily serve up the now-downed node's data partition until a replacement can be erected for the offline node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault Tolerance is a fancy term for data redundancy, should a node serving up a particular partition of the aggeregate data set go offline.  As stated above, nodes work together to back up one another's data (but still are responsible for exposing only a fixed partition of the data set).  So if a node goes offline, one of the other nodes can temporarily serve up the now-downed node's data partition until a replacement can be erected for the offline node.\n",

    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "This has been answered in Question 3, above.\n",
